# 🧠 ModelKarma: AI Trust & Fairness Scoring Engine

ModelKarma is a production-grade framework to quantify **AI model trust**, monitor **fairness**, and provide **explainable accountability** for machine learning systems. It is designed for real-world, enterprise use—featuring LLM-based introspection, causal explainability, fairness metrics, and automated recovery mechanisms.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Trust Scoring Engine** – Quantifies trust using explainability, drift, and fairness metrics.
- 🧪 **Fairness & Bias Auditing** – Detects and visualizes demographic bias across predictions.
- 📈 **Causal Explainability** – SHAP & counterfactual explanations for predictions.
- 🔄 **Self-Healing Recovery** – Auto-detect failure modes and recover via fallback models or LLM agents.
- 💬 **LLM-Powered Commentary** – Local LLMs (Ollama) explain issues in plain language.
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards** – Real-time visualization of model trust, drift, and logs via Streamlit.
- 🛠️ **Modular Architecture** – Clean plug-and-play components for ML observability.
